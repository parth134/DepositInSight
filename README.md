# DepositInSight

By accurately predicting whether a customer is likely to subscribe to a term deposit, banks can optimize their marketing campaigns and focus their efforts on customers who have a higher probability of conversion. 

## Overview
The Term Deposit Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit offered by a bank. It utilizes a dataset containing various customer attributes and previous marketing campaign outcomes. The project is implemented using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and pandas.

## Features
- Predict the likelihood of a customer subscribing to a term deposit
- Explore and analyze the customer dataset
- Train and evaluate different machine learning models
- Optimize marketing efforts and improve campaign success rate
- Develop a user-friendly interface for predictions
- Provide insights on important features affecting subscription likelihood

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/term-deposit-prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd term-deposit-prediction`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Ensure you have the customer dataset in the appropriate format (CSV, Excel, etc.).
2. Modify the configuration file (`config.json`) to specify the dataset file path and other settings.
3. Run the main script: `python main.py`
4. Follow the prompts to preprocess the data, train the model, or make predictions.
5. View the results, metrics, and visualizations generated by the program.
6. To use the user-friendly interface:
   - Run the Streamlit application: `streamlit run app.py`
   - Open the provided URL in your web browser to access the application.
   - Input customer information and obtain subscription likelihood predictions.

## Data Format
The customer dataset should be in a tabular format, such as CSV or Excel, with each row representing a customer and each column representing a feature. The dataset should include the target variable, indicating whether the customer subscribed to a term deposit (e.g., 0 for no, 1 for yes).

## Dependencies
- Python 3.7+
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- streamlit (for the user interface)
